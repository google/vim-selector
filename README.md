selector is a utility to help plugin authors launch a window to choose one of
several options.

For details, see the executable documentation in the `vroom/` directory or the
helpfiles in the `doc/` directory. The helpfiles are also available via
`:help selector` if selector is installed (and helptags have been generated).

# Installation

This example uses [Vundle](https://github.com/gmarik/Vundle.vim), whose
plugin-adding command is `Plugin`.

```vim
" Add maktaba and selector to the runtimepath.
" (The latter must be installed before it can be used.)
Plugin 'google/maktaba'
Plugin 'google/vim-selector'
```
